Following could not be corrected/ completed -
1)When matching the species with its card to increase the card count, 'Twi'lek' species shows an error, when .hasOwnProperty() is used on 'speciesCardList' object, in the browser console. But, it doesn't effect the code, and the code is running as expected.
2)The sorting and searching features couldn't be added due to lack of time. But can be implemented if asked to do so in the future.

//Running the code --
1)First of all, keep all the files in the same folder.
2)Now open the html in any browser of your choice. It will better if you open it with live server in VS Code.
3)Now you can go through all the pages and look at all the data fetched from the API.
